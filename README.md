## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The Convex Optimization Project mains to deal with Convex Problem in C++ environment, it's my Algorithm & Code Practice Project.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before use the prooject, you might need to have a C++ enviroment, e.g. g++, gcc, clang, bazel

for g++, gcc:
sudo apt install xxx

for bazel:
https://bazel.build/install

### Installing

waiting...

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

if you want to run all the tests with results:
bazel test --cxxopt=-std=c++17 --remote_cache="" --test_output=all //...

or if you just wanna run only one test:
bazel test --cxxopt=-std=c++17 --remote_cache="" --test_output=all //test/coretest/ConvexOptimizatoin/SteepestGradientDescent:steepest_gradient_descent_test

### Break down into end to end tests

### And coding style tests

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

if you wanna to use the lib, you can add the lib in your project. in Bazel, its very easy to do that, just append lib name in deps.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

I only test it on Ubuntu22.04, i think it may also works on other platforms

## ‚õèÔ∏è Built Using <a name = "built_using"></a>

for build the project, i use gtest and glog, you can see them in WORKSPACE file. if it doesn't work for you, you can replace it as you local installed libs.
